This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating through an array. The bug.java file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index, leading to an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bugSolution.java file provides the corrected code with the proper loop condition to avoid the error. This example highlights the importance of careful array index management in programming.
